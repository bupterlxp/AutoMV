    "prompt": "Subject: Eleven (close-up face) and the man (profile). Context: Cozy, intimate indoor setting with soft ambient light. Action: Eleven's face shows hesitation and curiosity; she takes a small, almost imperceptible step forward then stops; the man turns slightly. Style: Warm, romantic, cinematic with a slightly desaturated look. Camera Motion & Angle: Subtle dolly in on Eleven's face, then slight pan right to capture the man's turning profile at eye level. Composition: Close-up (Eleven's face), then tight two-shot (Eleven and man's profile). Ambiance: Soft, warm light catching the man's profile, slightly desaturated tones, intimate and tender.",
